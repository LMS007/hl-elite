# Halfe-Life Elite

An orignal Half-Life mod from 2004 for pro half-life players. It was launched before Steam existed but did migrate to Steam when it first came online. It was one of only 16 games on Steam at the time so I presume we could re-upload it to Steam with the orginal app ID.

Steam APP id: (I think)
`1:418088`

Note: This code was last run on Visual Studio 2008
